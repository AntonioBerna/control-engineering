## Create a Symbolic Link for Matlab

If during the installation of Matlab you forgot to add to the system PATH then you can use the following command to create a symbolic link:

```shell
sudo ln -s /usr/local/MATLAB/R2023b/bin/matlab /usr/local/bin/matlab
```

> [!WARNING]
> Don't copy and paste. Make sure the version you are installing is `R2023b` otherwise change the path!
